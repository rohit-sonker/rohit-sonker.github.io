Iâ€™m Rohit Sonker, a researcher at Auton Lab at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. Jeff Schneider.
I am broadly interesed in developing AI algorithms for applications in real world domains. Currently, I work on Offline Reinforcement Learning, Optimal Experiment design with Bayesian Optimization, and multi-modal foundational models combining text and time-series data, with application to the field of Nuclear Fusion.

Prior to this, I led the Data science and Machine learning team at CS DISCO India Office working on Machine learning and Large Language Model applications to help attorneys in E-discovery, document review and building cases. 
Before that, at PwC, I led several projects on the development of AI based intelligent clinical trial design leveraging predictive models, simulations and LLMs.

### AI for Nuclear Fusion

#### Bayesian Optimization for Experiment Design - 
Worked on developing a multi-scale bayesian optimization algorithm to achieve different goals pertaining to plasma control in nuclear fusion. Our algorithm has been tested at DIII-D tokamak facility in San Diego to mitigate tearing mode instabilities and also at K-STAR tokamak in South Korea for betaN (normalized plasma pressure) maximization. 
  - Papers currently under submission


#### Reinforcement Learning - 
Designed pipeline for distributed training and hyperparameter tuning of Reinforcement Learning agents for closed loop control of fusion tokamak actuators. I work on developing controllers for plasma profile tracking (eg. Density, Rotation, Differential Rotation)


#### Multi-Modal Foundational Models for Nuclear Fusion -
I am actively working on multi-modal state transition model which combines text logs from DIII-D experiments with trajectory data to enhance model performance and enable language conditioned data generation.
