Iâ€™m Rohit Sonker, a researcher at Auton Lab at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. Jeff Schneider.
I work on developing AI algorithms with applications to Nuclear Fusion. This includes Offline Reinforcement Learning, Optimal Experiment design with Bayesian Optimization, and multi-modal foundational models combining text and time-series data. Prior to this I spent some years working in industry where I led teams to design scalable, AI-driven solutions to accelerate clinical design at PwC and LLM solutions for legal tech at DISCO.

Prior to this, I led the Data science and Machine learning team at CS DISCO India Office working on Machine learning and Large Language Model applications to help attorneys in ediscovery, document review and building cases. Before that, at PwC, I led several projects on the development of AI based intelligent clinical trial design leveraging predictive models, simulations and LLMs.
